# scrapejs

This is the start of a much larger project. I will be creating an electron desktop
package that will fetch films and tv shows from various websites and allow the user
to browse said films and tv shows, stream them or download them.
The functionality will be similar to that of the Kodi addon Exodus.

** 21/01/2017 **
So far all this does is fetch featured film titles, urls and image urls and
stores them in an sqlite3 database.

## How to

You will need node.js installed on your system.

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/jamiejackherer/scrape.git
# cd into the new Clone
cd scrape
# Run the script
node scraping.js
```
